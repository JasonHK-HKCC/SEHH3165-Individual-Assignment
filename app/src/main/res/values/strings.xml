    <string name="zodiac_aries">Aries</string>
    <string name="zodiac_aries_summary">
        Aries is the first sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from approximately
        March 21 to April 19.\n
        \n
        The first sign of the zodiac, Aries loves to be number one. Naturally, this dynamic fire
        sign is no stranger to competition. Bold and ambitious, Aries dives headfirst into even the
        most challenging situations—and they’ll make sure they always come out on top!
    </string>
    <string name="zodiac_taurus">Taurus</string>
    <string name="zodiac_taurus_summary">
        Aries is the second sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from
        approximately April 20 to May 20.\n
        \n
        What sign is more likely to take a six-hour bath, followed by a luxurious Swedish massage
        and decadent dessert spread? Why Taurus, of course! Taurus is an earth sign represented by
        the bull. Like their celestial spirit animal, Taureans enjoy relaxing in serene, bucolic
        environments surrounded by soft sounds, soothing aromas, and succulent flavors.
    </string>
    <string name="zodiac_gemini">Gemini</string>
    <string name="zodiac_gemini_summary">
        Aries is the third sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from approximately
        May 21 to June 21.\n
        \n
        Have you ever been so busy that you wished you could clone yourself just to get everything
        done? That’s the Gemini experience in a nutshell. Spontaneous, playful, and adorably erratic,
        Gemini is driven by its insatiable curiosity. Appropriately symbolized by the celestial
        twins, this air sign was interested in so many pursuits that it had to double itself. You
        know, NBD!
    </string>
    <string name="zodiac_cancer">Cancer</string>
    <string name="zodiac_cancer_summary">
        Aries is the fourth sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from
        approximately June 22 to July 22.\n
        \n
        Represented by the crab, Cancer seamlessly weaves between the sea and shore representing
        Cancer’s ability to exist in both emotional and material realms. Cancers are highly
        intuitive and their psychic abilities manifest in tangible spaces. But—just like the
        hard-shelled crustaceans—this water sign is willing to do whatever it takes to protect
        itself emotionally. In order to get to know this sign, you’re going to need to establish
        trust!
    </string>
    <string name="zodiac_leo">Leo</string>
    <string name="zodiac_leo_summary">
        Aries is the fifth sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from approximately
        July 23 to August 22.\n
        \n
        Roll out the red carpet because Leo has arrived. Passionate, loyal, and infamously dramatic,
        Leo is represented by the lion and these spirited fire signs are the kings and queens of the
        celestial jungle. They’re delighted to embrace their royal status: Vivacious, theatrical,
        and fiery, Leos love to bask in the spotlight and celebrate… well, themselves.
    </string>
    <string name="zodiac_virgo">Virgo</string>
    <string name="zodiac_virgo_summary">
        Aries is the sixth sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from approximately
        August 23 to September 22.\n
        \n
        You know the expression, “if you want something done, give it to a busy person?” Well, that
        definitely is the Virgo anthem. Virgos are logical, practical, and systematic in their
        approach to life. Virgo is an earth sign historically represented by the goddess of wheat
        and agriculture, an association that speaks to Virgo’s deep-rooted presence in the material
        world. This earth sign is a perfectionist at heart and isn’t afraid to improve skills
        through diligent and consistent practice.
    </string>
    <string name="zodiac_libra">Libra</string>
    <string name="zodiac_libra_summary">
        Aries is the seventh sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from
        approximately September 23 to October 22.\n
        \n
        Balance, harmony, and justice define Libra energy. As a cardinal air sign, Libra is
        represented by the scales (interestingly, the only inanimate object of the zodiac), an
        association that reflects Libra’s fixation on establishing equilibrium. Libra is obsessed
        with symmetry and strives to create equilibrium in all areas of life — especially when it
        comes to matters of the heart.
    </string>
    <string name="zodiac_scorpius">Scorpius</string>
    <string name="zodiac_scorpius_summary">
        Aries is the eighth sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from
        approximately October 23 to November 22.\n
        \n
        Elusive and mysterious, Scorpio is one of the most misunderstood signs of the zodiac.
        Scorpio is a water sign that uses emotional energy as fuel, cultivating powerful wisdom
        through both the physical and unseen realms. In fact, Scorpio derives its extraordinary
        courage from its psychic abilities, which is what makes this sign one of the most
        complicated, dynamic signs of the zodiac.
    </string>
    <string name="zodiac_sagittarius">Sagittarius</string>
    <string name="zodiac_sagittarius_summary">
        Aries is the ninth sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from approximately
        November 23 to December 21.\n
        \n
        Oh, the places Sagittarius goes! But… actually. This fire sign knows no bounds. Represented
        by the archer, Sagittarians are always on a quest for knowledge. The last fire sign of the
        zodiac, Sagittarius launches its many pursuits like blazing arrows, chasing after
        geographical, intellectual, and spiritual adventures.
    </string>
    <string name="zodiac_capricornus">Capricornus</string>
    <string name="zodiac_capricornus_summary">
        Aries is the tenth sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from approximately
        December 22 to January 19.\n
        \n
        What is the most valuable resource? For Capricorn, the answer is clear: Time. Capricorn is
        climbing the mountain straight to the top and knows that patience, perseverance, and
        dedication is the only way to scale. The last earth sign of the zodiac, Capricorn, is
        represented by the sea-goat, a mythological creature with the body of a goat and the tail of
        a fish. Accordingly, Capricorns are skilled at navigating both the material and emotional
        realms.

    <string name="zodiac_aquarius">Aquarius</string>
    <string name="zodiac_aquarius_summary">
        Aries is the eleventh sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from
        approximately January 20 to February 18.\n
        \n
        Despite the “aqua” in its name, Aquarius is actually the last air sign of the zodiac.
        Innovative, progressive, and shamelessly revolutionary, Aquarius is represented by the water
        bearer, the mystical healer who bestows water, or life, upon the land. Accordingly, Aquarius
        is the most humanitarian astrological sign. At the end of the day, Aquarius is dedicated to
        making the world a better place.
    </string>
    <string name="zodiac_pisces">Pisces</string>
    <string name="zodiac_pisces_summary">
        Aries is the twelfth sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from
        approximately February 19 to March 20.\n
        \n
        If you looked up the word “psychic” in the dictionary, there would definitely be a picture
        of Pisces next to it. Pisces is the most intuitive, sensitive, and empathetic sign of the
        entire zodiac — and that’s because it’s the last of the last. As the final sign, Pisces has
        absorbed every lesson — the joys and the pain, the hopes and the fears — learned by all of
        the other signs. It’s symbolized by two fish swimming in opposite directions, representing
        the constant division of Pisces’ attention between fantasy and reality.
